        I built <strong><span class="highlight">Vikram's Social Links</span></strong> as my second independent project, focusing on creating a simple yet impactful personal website. The main goal was to design a <strong><span class="highlight">minimal, clean, and functional landing page</span></strong> where all my important links could be found in one place. Unlike my first independent project (GlamHub Store), this one was about combining simplicity with a personal brand identity, while still practicing my front-end development skills.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The website features a <strong><span class="highlight">profile section</span></strong> at the top with my name and a short introduction, followed by neatly designed <strong><span class="highlight">social media buttons</span></strong> that link to my profiles across platforms. I used a clean card-style layout with hover effects to make the design more engaging and intuitive. Responsiveness was also a key focus, ensuring the page looks and works smoothly on both desktop and mobile.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Through this project, I improved my skills in <strong><span class="highlight">UI design and layout structuring</span></strong> while also learning how to align design choices with personal branding. It gave me confidence to build lightweight, effective websites that serve a clear purpose. The final outcome is a <strong><span class="highlight">personal social link hub</span></strong> that works as my digital visiting card, helping me share my work and connect easily.
